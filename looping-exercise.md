# Exercise: Print Numbers from 1 to 10

**Objective:** Write a JavaScript program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.

## Instructions:

1. Open your code editor and create a new JavaScript file named `printNumbers.js`.
2. Inside the file, write a `for` loop that starts from 1 and ends at 10.
3. Inside the loop, use `console.log()` to print each number.

## Additional Challenge

- modify the program to print the numbers from 10 to 1 instead.

# Exercise: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 10

**Objective:** Write a JavaScript program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.

## Instructions:

1. Open your code editor and create a new JavaScript file named `sumNumbers.js`.
2. Inside the file, write a `while` loop that starts from 1 and ends at 10.
3. Use a variable to keep track of the sum of the numbers.
4. Print the final sum using `console.log()`.

## Additional Challenge

- modify the program to calculate the sum of even numbers from 1 to 20.

# Exercise: Print Even Numbers from 1 to 20

**Objective:** Write a JavaScript program that prints all even numbers from 1 to 20 using a `do...while` loop.

## Instructions:

1. Open your code editor and create a new JavaScript file named `printEvenNumbers.js`.
2. Inside the file, write a `do...while` loop that starts from 1 and ends at 20.
3. Inside the loop, use an `if` statement to check if the number is even.
4. If the number is even, print it using `console.log()`.

## Additional Challenge

- modify the program to print all odd numbers from 1 to 20.
