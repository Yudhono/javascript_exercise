# Exercise: Working with JavaScript Objects

## Objective:

Learn how to create and manipulate objects in JavaScript.

## Instructions:

1. **Create an Object**: Define an object named `student` with the following properties:

   - `name`: A string representing the student's name.
   - `age`: A number representing the student's age.
   - `grade`: A string representing the student's grade.
   - `favorite_food`: An array of strings representing the studen favorite food.

2. **Access Properties**: Write code to print the student's name and age to the console.

3. **Add a Property**: Add a new property `school` to the `student` object and set it to the name of the school.

4. **Update a Property**: Change the student's grade to a new value.

5. **Delete a Property**: Remove the `age` property from the `student` object.

6. **Loop through Properties**: Use a loop to print all the properties and their values of the `student` object.
